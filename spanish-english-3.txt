To  my  father 


The  editor  would  like  to  give  special  thanks  to  Hugh  Rawson, 
my  former  editor  at  New  American  Library  for  almost  twenty 
years,  who  initiated  this  project  and  guided  me  through  many 
others  over  the  years.  Thanks  are  also  due  to  Sarah  Manges, 
who  ably  picked  up  this  project  from  Hugh  and  has  been  of 
great  help  to  me  in  its  completion.  Thanks  to  my  long-suffering 
wife,  Patricia  Morehead,  composer  and  oboist,  who  put  up 
with  my  endless  hours  at  the  computer.  And  finally,  I  would 
like  to  acknowledge  the  hard  work  of  my  late  father  and 
mother,  Albert  H.  Morehead  and  Loy  Morehead,  who  together 
were  responsible  for  the  original  work  on  which  this  volume  is 
based. 


HOW  TO  USE  THIS  THESAURUS 


PETER  MARK  ROGET  was  an  English  physician  who  was  born  in  1779 
and  who  died  in  1869.  As  a  hobby  he  liked  to  make  lists  of  words  and  group 
them  together  when  they  were  related  to  one  another.  Some  were  related  be¬ 
cause  they  were  synonyms,  such  as  illegal  and  unlawful;  some  because  they 
were  antonyms,  such  as  peaceful  and  warlike;  some  because  they  were  re¬ 
minders  of  one  another,  such  as  father  and  mother.  Altogether  Mr.  Roget 
made  a  thousand  different  groups,  or  categories,  of  related  words.  Every 
word  he  knew  or  could  find  in  the  dictionaries  he  had  was  classified  in  one 
or  more  of  these  categories.  In  1852,  Mr.  Roget’s  list  of  words  was  pub¬ 
lished.  He  called  the  book  a  thesaurus,  or  treasury,  of  words.  There  were  not 
many  words  in  the  first  Roget’s  Thesaurus  compared  to  the  number  in  a  vol¬ 
ume  like  this,  but  his  book  was  the  first  collection  of  synonyms,  antonyms, 
and  other  related  words.  Not  only  writers,  but  also  many  others  found  it  in¬ 
valuable.  Dozens  of  editors,  beginning  with  Mr.  Roget’s  son,  have  revised 
the  original  Thesaurus,  added  to  it,  and  brought  it  up  to  date  (for  many  of 
the  words  in  the  original  Roget  list  are  now  obsolete  and  many  common 
words  of  today  were  unknown  in  his  time);  but  virtually  every  edition  is  still 
called  Roget’s  Thesaurus  in  honor  of  the  man  who  first  had  the  idea. 

This  edition  of  Roget’s  Thesaurus  is  both  a  dictionary  of  synonyms  and 
a  thesaurus,  or  “treasury,”  of  related  words.  It  combines  in  one  easy-to-use 
alphabetical  list  categories  (very  much  like  those  in  Roget’s  original  the¬ 
saurus)  and  a  list  of  words  with  their  close  synonyms.  For  clarity,  each  cat¬ 
egory  is  printed  the  full  width  of  the  page  and  set  off  in  a  box  while  the  syn¬ 
onym  listings  are  printed  at  half-page  width. 

To  find  synonyms  for  a  word,  first  look  up  the  word  in  the  alphabetical 
list.  In  most  cases,  you  will  find  what  you  are  looking  for  immediately  un¬ 
der  that  word.  Reference  to  more  synonyms  is  indicated  by  words  printed  in 
SMALL  CAPITALS.  If  you  look  Up  the  word  or  words  referred  to,  you  will  find 
additional  synonyms  and  other  words  related  to  the  word  you  were  looking 
up.  Most  references  are  to  categories,  where  you  will  also  find  words  of  re¬ 
lated  meaning  but  different  parts  of  speech.  Antonyms  are  listed  for  many 
synonym  entries,  and  at  the  end  of  each  category  entry  you  will  find  refer¬ 
ences  to  sources  for  antonyms. 

A  special  feature  of  this  edition  is  the  inclusion  of  many  phrases  and  quo¬ 
tations,  both  contemporary  and  historical,  appropriate  to  a  certain  category. 

Frequently  only  one  form  of  a  word  is  entered  in  the  alphabetical  word 
list.  You  will  find  synonyms  for  the  other  forms  by  referring  to  the  entries 
printed  in  small  capitals  under  the  listed  word.  For  example,  to  find  syn¬ 
onyms  for  proximate,  look  under  proximity  in  the  alphabetical  word  list  and 
refer  to  the  category  nearness,  where  you  find  adjacent,  adjoining  and 
other  related  adjectives. 


How  to  Use  This  Thesaurus 

A  word  or  phrase  in  parentheses — (  ) — is  explanatory  or  shows  how  the 
preceding  word  is  to  be  used  in  a  sentence.  Brackets — [  ] — indicate  that  the 
bracketed  letters,  word,  or  phrase  might  or  might  not  be  used  with  the  ad¬ 
joining  word,  depending  on  the  preference  of  the  writer. 

In  the  listings,  synonyms  for  different  senses  of  the  listed  word  are  sepa¬ 
rated  by  semicolons  (;).  Informal  and  slang  senses  of  the  entry  word  are  la¬ 
beled  informal  or  slang  at  the  beginning  of  each  sense;  informal  and  slang 
synonyms  for  all  senses  of  the  entry  word  are  listed  separately,  headed  by  In¬ 
formal  or  Slang,  respectively.  Moreover,  entry  words  or  individual  synonyms 
might  be  labeled  to  indicates  special  or  substandard  usage.  The  most  com¬ 
monly  used  labels — in  addition  to  informal  and  slang — are  dial,  (dialectal), 
Brit.  (British),  poetic,  and  archaic. 

In  the  category  entries,  numbered  senses  are  often  preceded  by  a  contex¬ 
tual  gist  label  in  parentheses  and  italics  that  indicates  the  meaning  being  cov¬ 
ered  in  that  paragraph.  These  labels  can  help  you  find  the  right  word  more 
quickly. 

Familiar  dictionary  abbreviations  are  used  for  parts  of  speech:  n.,  noun; 
V.,  verb;  v.i.,  intransitive  verb;  v.t.,  transitive  verb;  adj.,  adjective;  adv.,  ad¬ 
verb;  pran.,  pronoun;  prep.,  preposition;  conj.,  conjunction;  inter].,  interjec¬ 
tion. 

This  is  not  a  dictionary.  It  does  not  define  words  except  to  the  extent  that 
they  are  defined  in  their  synonyms.  A  word  that  has  no  natural  synonyms  is 
not  entered  merely  to  define  it.  Moreover,  alternate  spellings  for  a  word  are 
generally  not  given.  The  publishers  of  this  thesaurus  also  publish  a  compan¬ 
ion  volume,  The  New  American  Webster  Handy  College  Dictionary,  which 
was  the  authority  for  the  preferred  spellings  used  herein  and  in  which  may 
be  found  definitions  of  most  of  the  words  in  this  book. 

Antonyms  formed  by  simply  adding  un-,  in-,  dis-,  etc.,  are  generally  not 
given,  nor  are  words  listed  when  they  are  simple  negatives  of  other  words. 
For  example,  such  a  word  as  unloved  is  not  entered  because  one  may  merely 
look  up  the  positive  term,  but  unbearable  is  entered  because  the  positive 
term  has  various  dissimilar  meanings. 

The  editor  appreciates  readers’  suggestions  for  additions  to  the  word  list, 
phrases,  and  quotations,  and  any  other  comments.  Comments  and  sugges¬ 
tions  can  be  sent  to  the  editor  by  e-mail  at  pmorehead@philsbooks.com.
